Feel free to submit pull requests and stuff. Also feel free to message me on facebook if a part of the code doesn't make sense.

## How to run locally

It's best to use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or Apache.

## How to sync WorldWarMap with WorldWarBot

Add events to events.txt. Follow the format. Run `python3 serializeEvents.py`. events.json will update itself. That's it.
